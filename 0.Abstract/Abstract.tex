% \abstract{In this paper, we present a novel contour tracing algorithm based on the pixel following method for fast and accurate contour following. The proposed algorithm distinguishes between types of contour such as a local pattern type based on its relative location among several contour pixels, and then it traces the next contour pixel by using the previous. Therefore, it can classify the type of contour pixels into straight line, inner corner, outer corner, and inner-outer corner, and it can extract pixels of a specific contour type. Moreover, it can trace contour pixels rapidly because it can determine the local minimal path using the contour case. In addition, the proposed algorithm has the ability to compress data of contour pixels by using the representative points and inner-outer corner points, and it can also accurately restore the contour image from the data. To compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with that of conventional techniques, we measured their processing time and accuracy. In the experimental results, the proposed algorithm shows better performance when compared to the others, and it can provide compressed data of contour pixels and restore them accurately, including the inner-outer corner that cannot be restored using conventional algorithms.}
