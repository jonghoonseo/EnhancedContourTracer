\section{Introduction}

A contour is defined as a segment that is one pixel wide and one or more pixels in length, and a boundary is defined as an unbroken contour\cite{Mcqueen2004Contour}. Contours and boundaries are very important information for object representation and image recognition. For example, they are used to separate objects from the background, to calculate the size of an object, to classify a shape, and to find the feature points of an object using the length and shape from its contour pixels\cite{Pratt????Digital,Gose1996Pattern}. Moreover, using the contour information, it is possible to save the shape of objects and restore them to their original shapes for various applications in the field of graphics and vision. Therefore, many researches on contour tracing algorithms for extracting and tracing the contour of an object have been conducted. Most of the algorithms are binary-image-based contour tracing algorithms [2]â€“[9], which trace contours on digitized black-and-white images. Moreover, the focus is on contour tracing algorithms based on color images and gray images []; further, the binary-image-based contour tracing algorithm can be easily applied to color and gray images.
